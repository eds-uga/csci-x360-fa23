# Workshop 0: Installing Python from Anaconda

In this folder you'll find all the materials associated with the 0th workshop for installing Python from Anaconda.

The main resource is the `ipynb` Jupyter notebook, which walks you through this process (though some of it may reference old dates or course websites; the main technical information should be fine).

The `Dockerfile` is provided as a reference for completeness; it is not only NOT required to run Python, it is also not recommended that you use Docker as your primary interface for Python. It is provided for demonstration purposes.
