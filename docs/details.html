										Discord is our primary method of communication. The email
										you receive from me inviting you to the Discord server will likely be the
										last email I will proactively send you. While you are welcome
										to email me, I receive dozens--sometimes hundreds--of emails
										each day. Discord cuts through the noise, making it much more
										likely I will respond to questions on the server. Plus,
										in Discord, you have your student colleagues who can probably
										help even more quickly.

										on a Tuesday</strong>.

										Take note: AutoLab is run from an internal UGA server, and can

									<h3 class="fas fa-coffee">Workshops</h3>

									<p>
										Workshops are held most Mondays. Each student is
										<strong>required to organize and lead at least
										one workshop</strong>, most likely requiring workshop 
										presentation teams of 2-3 students each week.
									</p>

									<p>
										Students taking CSCI 6360 are required to present 
										<strong>two workshops</strong>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Workshops are meant to be an opportunity to dig into the
										nuts and bolts of topics we are covering in lecture by
										demonstrating working code and how these topics can be
										implemented in practice. This can take several forms--students 
										are encouraged to be imaginative!
									</p>

									<p>
										You can demo a new Python package, show a better way of doing 
										something from lecture or homework, or even a live-coding session for how 
										to solve a certain problem (though it should go without saying that 
										you need to <em>practice</em> the live coding ahead of time).
									</p>

									<p>
										The current schedule can be found
										<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S9fuFx47iEiB5z0grZURiRu7aBYdiB3bGUPmob25zyw/edit#gid=0">here</a>.

										The midterm exam will be <strong>Thursday, October 12</strong>.
										Expect a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and coding
										questions.
									</p>

									<p>
										If you opt to do the Final Project instead of the midterm, you 
										<strong>do not need to attend class on the day of the midterm exam</strong>.

									<p>
										You are encouraged to form teams of 2 or 3. Larger teams, or teams 
										of a single individual, are not forbidden but are discouraged.
									</p>

									<p>
										There are three components: the <strong>proposal</strong>, two 
										periodic <strong>updates</strong>, and the <strong>presentation</strong>. 
										The proposal is a 1-2 page roadmap of your project, detailing how you 
										plan to do it, any contingencies and outcomes you can surmise, 
										and your teammates. The updates entail two deadlines between 
										the proposal and the presentation where you specify in 1 page 
										what you have accomplished so far, any obstacles you have 
										encountered, how you plan to handle them, and any deviations you 
										anticipate from the plan spelled out in your proposal. The 
										presentation is a 25-minute talk summarizing your problem, 
										motivating your approach, and discussing your results. <!--The deliverable is a two-parter: the first is your code, and the second is a 6-10 page <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS-style paper</a>
										on your project.-->

										topic, these would be good places to start.

									<h3 class="fas fa-search">"A Culture of Honesty"</h3>

									<p>
										Here's the short version: <strong>don't copy code from the
											internets or from your friends.</strong> Coding is like
											writing: everyone has their own style, and it's easily
											recognizable. As such, forgery and plagiarism is also
											easily sniffed out. Plus, there are tools that do this
											for us now (this is, after all, a data science class).
										</p>

										<p>
											If cheating is uncovered, I am obligated to report the
											incident, no questions asked. As in, I don't warn you
											beforehand or give you a chance to apologize; the first
											you'll hear that I think you've been dishonest is from
											UGA, not me.
										</p>

										<p>
											The <a href="https://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy">UGA Academic Honesty Policy</a>
											is the final word on these matters. Lack of knowledge of
											these policies is not sufficient justification for
											violations. If in doubt, ask me.
										</p>

										<p>
											Use of chatbots is not prohibited, but not encouraged either.
											I won't go into the irony of using an ML-based chatbot
											specifically <em>not</em> optimized for conceptual correctness
											to help you ace an ML course, but suffice to say: like any
											other form of "presenting someone else's work as your own,"
											it's pretty easy to notice. I'll notice. And while I won't
											mark down for using it (unless it's incorrect, of course), don't 
											expect a glowing recommendation letter from me.
